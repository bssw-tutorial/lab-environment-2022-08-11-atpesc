Phase 1 Executive Summary
-------------------------
In phase 2, much of the living executive summary content is contained in the
phase 2 notebook.  Instead of doing that we could make the notebook simpler by
putting that documentation here.  Also, we could put the traditional, detailed,
frozen-at-creation lab notes here.

Because the phase 2 notebook was constructed to be comprehensive and
complicated, there is no need for a README in that folder.
