This python package is a minimal stand-in for an in-house data analysis tool.
It's main use is that we run its unit tests in an example data analysis Jupyter
notebook as part of logging important notes.

__NOTE__: The structure and design of this python package is based off of a
very old template.  Some aspects are deprecated and, therefore, this design
should be considered to be out-of-date.
